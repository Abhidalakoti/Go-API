# Go-API
A Golang RESTful API demonstrating a full suite of CRUD operations


This is a fully fledged  fully-fledged REST API that exposes GET, POST, DELETE and PUT endpoints that will subsequently allow  to perform the full range of CRUD operations.In this there is no interaction with any backend database technologies to store the articles that weâ€™ll be playing with. However,  REST API is written in such a way that it will be easy to update the functions  defined so that they make subsequent calls to a database to perform any necessary CRUD operations.
